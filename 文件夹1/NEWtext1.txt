Many students wonder whether they should start their first job experience in a
state-owned business to seek security or in a joint venture to pursue higher income? As for me, I would choose to work in a private joint venture.
On one hand, in a joint adventure enterprise,there are more room and chance for us to grow and promote. That is because in such corporations, work and promotion are directly related. The better you work, the higher will be your growth. Although state-owned enterprise also has its rules for promotion, it tends to be less flexible.
On the other hand, people working for a
joint-venture company are more likely to get pay raise. Since the level of salaries is
decided within the company, instead of being based on central rules of the government,employees tend to get higher pay if their dedication and skills are recognized by the company.
